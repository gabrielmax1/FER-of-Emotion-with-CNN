Please before run me, setup enviroment:
Code PyCharm enviroment created on Anaconda.
Running Python 3.6 version, tensorflow-gpu 2.1.0, keras-gpu 2.3.1, CUDA 10.1.243, cudNN 7.6.5 versions.

If you are in a hurry, you can open the jupyter file "FERCNN.ipynb", which is as good for training, although the prediction part requires debugging as
it has compability issues with the one used in Py. 

Thank you all

If you experience any issues, feel free to contact me on Teams, I'm very responsive.

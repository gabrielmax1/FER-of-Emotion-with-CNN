# FER-of-Emotion-with-CNN
Facial Expression Recognition of Emotion using Deep Learning CNN

I used FER2013 as dataset, because I consider it a good starting to point to keep it simple in term of complexity of size and computationally of the dataset,
but also to make it hard to achieve a good accuracy, as FER2013 is an outdated dataset, unbalance and poor of details.

Validation accuracy 66% training on FER2013, tested using different dataset, or webcam input (photo, or real-time video).

This is a study based on the assumption of Universality of Emotions via Facial Expressions along cultures, backgrounds and ethnicities.
